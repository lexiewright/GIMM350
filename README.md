# GIMM350

Research strategy: I like to look for code that comes right from Git. Another thing to look for is how old the code and the solutions are.
If the code is from 2016,I know that Version of Unity might not be the best bet. I also like to see if the author of the book 
or tutorial had a version of the project that they have personally uploaded. Then I can make sure that the code is align with what 
they are talking about. I also like ot include the word "solution" when I am searching for something. Stimes the right
question is asked but there has not been a solution found for it.
